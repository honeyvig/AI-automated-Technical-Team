# AI-automated-Technical-Team
I'm new to Upwork and want to build a technical team to help me deliver solutions to my clients. A LITTLE ABOUT ME: - over 30 years of hands-on experience in coding, systems architecture, and business development, marketing, and so on. - 50% of everything I earn is donated to secure the release of child soldiers from the army in Myanmar. - at age 12 I was coding BASIC on an Apple II, then Assembly language, C, C+, and Fortran. I left school early and joined The CSIRO’s WLAN project—where Wi-Fi was invented—working with Fast Fourier Transforms, Error-Correcting Codes, Integrated Circuits, and Interleaving as part of the radiophysics division. - left school early and worked for the Australian government (defence). I worked on classified projects, focussing on security, data forensics and cryptography. I worked with embedded systems, real-time systems, and code optimisation; Mainly Linux distributions but also OSX and WIN. - started a video production company, I.T. consulting company, printing company, etc... had offices worldwide. Sold everything and retired at age 38. - spent the next 10 years travelling the world, coding automated trading strategies (forex). Now I want to simply consult. I don't want to code. That's where you come in. IMPORTANT: I am hyper-logical, fierce, non-apologetic, and I don't give praise. I only care about results; anything less than that is 100% failure. I'm busy. I work 70 hours a week. This leaves little time for encouragement, thank-you's, or small talk. Your job satisfaction, nay, life satisfaction will only ever come from YOU. There's nothing I can say to make you feel good about yourself so I don't bother trying. Take agency, be in control of your own job satisfaction and do the work, get paid. Simple. With that in mind... IMPORTANT: English proficiency is a MUST. Please only apply if your English is excellent. I speak a high-level of English using complex words and sentence structure. I can not allow misunderstandings to happen because of a lack of English proficiency. I need people who are natives to, or have spent a significant portion of their childhood in, a country where English was the predominant language. IMPORTANT: Cultural understanding is a MUST. I grew up in a western country. I need natives of western countries to ensure there's no communication issues because of cultural differences. If you don't know what "fair swing of the cat", or "he's at the end of his tether" means, then it's likely you won't be suitable for this job. IMPORTANT: There is ongoing work for the right person. I'll start by giving you a few "test" jobs (which you'll get paid for), and we'll see how you do. I want to build a team of contractors for both my clients and myself. That's the goal. IMPORTANT: If there's nothing on your profile to show that you've had experience with this type of work then please do not apply. IMPORTANT: I don't hire people for less an USD$20 per hour. If you profile doesn't show a history of earning at least USD$20 per hour then please do not apply. IMPORTANT: Sorry, no agencies. I prefer to work directly with freelancers. IMPORTANT: You must work using the time tracker. I never allow manual time. IMPORTANT: There is no job description other than the above. I need a team of people I can draw on for 5 minutes of advice, or 50 hours of project work. It all depends on the client. Please respond by specifically addressing the points raised in this job posting. Generic applications and AI-generated ones (yes, the AI ones are obviously AI) are just not cool.

\=================

To address the requirements you've mentioned in the job description and provide a Python solution for building a technical team to deliver solutions to your clients, I'll guide you on how to automate the process of creating and managing a team of freelancers, utilizing Python and a few APIs. Here's how we can proceed:
Steps Involved:

    Building a Profile Management System:
        We can create an automated profile management system where freelancers can apply, and you can filter them based on specific requirements (such as experience, hourly rate, location, etc.).

    Integration with Upwork:
        Upwork API: Upwork offers APIs that you can use to automate certain tasks related to managing profiles, job postings, and tracking contractors' work.

    Freelancer Selection Based on Criteria:
        Based on the details you provided, we can filter freelancers based on:
            Experience: Checking hourly rate, job history, and skill expertise.
            Language and Cultural Understanding: Freelancers from countries where English is predominantly spoken.
            Freelancer Availability: You mentioned ongoing work, so it’s important to track availability.

    Team Communication:
        Slack API: To set up communication channels and ensure constant real-time collaboration with your technical team.

    Time Tracking:
        Use Upwork’s time tracking API to ensure freelancers are logging hours correctly and you get detailed reports.

Technologies Used:

    Upwork API for profile management and tracking contractors.
    Slack API for communication and collaboration.
    Python for managing automation scripts, filtering freelancers, and ensuring quality control.

Step-by-step Python Solution Outline:

    Upwork API Integration (for Freelancer Management):

    The first step is to interact with Upwork’s API to fetch and filter freelancers based on your specified requirements like their hourly rate, country, and expertise. Note: The Upwork API requires an Upwork developer account, and you’ll need API keys to use it.

    Slack API Integration (for Real-Time Communication):

    Use Slack to create communication channels with your contractors. You can automate the creation of channels and send messages using Python.

    Automate Time Tracking (via Upwork API):

    Upwork provides APIs to fetch time tracking logs of freelancers. This ensures you're adhering to the policy of using Upwork’s time tracker.

Python Code Example:

import requests
import json

# Set up the Upwork API
UPWORK_API_KEY = "your_upwork_api_key"
UPWORK_ACCESS_TOKEN = "your_upwork_access_token"

# Function to get freelancer profiles from Upwork
def get_freelancer_profiles(query_params):
    url = f"https://www.upwork.com/api/profiles/v2/search.json?{query_params}"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {UPWORK_ACCESS_TOKEN}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()  # Return freelancer profiles
    else:
        print(f"Failed to fetch profiles: {response.status_code}")
        return None

# Function to filter freelancers based on specific criteria
def filter_freelancers(profiles, hourly_rate_min=20, country=None, language="English"):
    filtered_profiles = []
    for profile in profiles.get("profiles", []):
        if profile["hourly_rate"] >= hourly_rate_min and language in profile["languages"]:
            if country:
                if profile["location"]["country"] == country:
                    filtered_profiles.append(profile)
            else:
                filtered_profiles.append(profile)
    return filtered_profiles

# Function to send a message to Slack channel
def send_slack_message(slack_token, channel, message):
    url = "https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {slack_token}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
    data = {
        "channel": channel,
        "text": message,
    }
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print(f"Message sent to Slack channel {channel}")
    else:
        print(f"Failed to send message to Slack: {response.status_code}")

# Function to automate the time tracking report using Upwork API
def get_upwork_time_tracking(freelancer_id, start_date, end_date):
    url = f"https://www.upwork.com/api/workdiary/v1/time_entries.json?freelancer_id={freelancer_id}&start_date={start_date}&end_date={end_date}"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {UPWORK_ACCESS_TOKEN}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    }
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()  # Return time tracking data
    else:
        print(f"Failed to fetch time tracking data: {response.status_code}")
        return None

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example Upwork query parameters: (search for freelancers who are skilled in Python and English)
    query_params = "q=python&lang=english"
    freelancers = get_freelancer_profiles(query_params)
    
    if freelancers:
        # Filter freelancers based on the hourly rate and country
        filtered_freelancers = filter_freelancers(freelancers, hourly_rate_min=20, country="US")
        print(f"Filtered Freelancers: {filtered_freelancers}")
        
        # Send a message to Slack (Create a Slack Channel and send notifications)
        slack_token = "your_slack_token"
        slack_channel = "#team-upwork"
        message = "New freelancers have been filtered based on the requirements."
        send_slack_message(slack_token, slack_channel, message)

        # Check freelancer time logs for a specific freelancer
        freelancer_id = "freelancer_id_example"
        time_tracking = get_upwork_time_tracking(freelancer_id, "2024-01-01", "2024-01-31")
        print(f"Time Tracking Data: {time_tracking}")

Explanation:

    get_freelancer_profiles(): Fetches a list of freelancers based on query parameters such as skill and language.
    filter_freelancers(): Filters freelancers based on hourly rate and location.
    send_slack_message(): Sends a message to a specific Slack channel, useful for communicating with the team.
    get_upwork_time_tracking(): Fetches the time tracking data for a freelancer for a specific period to ensure proper time logging.

Key Points:

    Upwork API: This allows you to filter and manage freelancer profiles based on specific needs like experience, hourly rate, and skills.
    Slack API: Facilitates team communication and notifications for updates.
    Automated Time Tracking: Ensures that the time tracking is properly recorded and adheres to the system you requested (Upwork time tracker).
    Freelancer Filtering: Based on location (English-speaking countries) and hourly rate to match your criteria.

Final Notes:

    API Credentials: Make sure to replace placeholders (your_upwork_api_key, your_slack_token, etc.) with your actual API credentials.
    Ongoing Work: The system can be expanded to automate various aspects, such as sending weekly reminders to freelancers or fetching project status updates.
    Scalability: The code can be extended to handle larger datasets, such as fetching thousands of freelancer profiles, by implementing pagination or batch processing.

By using this framework, you can automate the process of managing your team, handling freelancer profiles, and ensuring the smooth operation of your projects.
